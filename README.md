I'm a full time employee, but do some freelancing from time to time. Sometimes, an oportunity to work on a project raises and I can get to bill some hours

This project is a very simple approach on how to inform a possible customer of the hours I've been working.

I'm just tracking worked hours using an ICS calendar. Then,  I'm using this Python script to calculate the total billable hours, and monthly total amount.

This is a work in progress. I plan to keep adding features like GIT interaction and PDF reports
